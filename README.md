## Medical Image Analysis
Medical Image Analysis for Malaria Detection

**Malaria** is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus **Plasmodium** that are transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes and that infect the red blood cells.

### How could I help the fight against malaria?

Deep learning + medical imaging system can help reduce the 400,000+ deaths per year caused by malaria. We’ll explore malaria database which contains blood smear images that fall into one of two classes: positive for malaria or negative for malaria.


### **A world map of areas currently affected by malaria**
Malaria is an infectious disease that causes over 400,000 deaths per year. Malaria is a true endemic in some areas of the world, meaning that the disease is regularly found in the region. In other areas of the world, malaria is an epidemic — it’s widespread in the area but not yet at endemic proportions. Yet in other areas of the world malaria is rarely, if ever, found at all.

### How can we test for malaria?
Two methods of testing for malaria include: 
1. Blood smears
2. Antigen testing (i.e., rapid tests)

The blood smear process can be visualized in Figure below:
1. First, a blood sample is taken from a patient and then placed on a slide.
2. The sample is stained with a contrasting agent to help highlight malaria parasites in red blood cells
3. A clinician then examines the slide under a microscope and manually counts the number of red blood cells that are infected.
